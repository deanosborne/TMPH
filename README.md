# TM Property helper

TM Property helper was made in an effort to reduce the amount of time used when looking for properties, made as a passion project it has the basic functionality, but alot of potential. Currently it will take a Trademe property link (resedential for sale), then scrape the details, rates prices and surrounding property sale prices. It makes use of Selenium and HTMLAgilityPack and is compatible with Christchurch properties.
